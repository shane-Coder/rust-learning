# Rust Learning

This repository contains my Rust learning notes and hands-on code examples.
It focuses on building strong fundamentals through small, executable programs
and concise explanations.

The content here is created at my own pace and is intended for learning,
experimentation, and future reference.

## What you’ll find here
- Concept-wise Rust examples written in `.rs` files
- Short notes explaining key ideas in simple terms
- Gradual progression from basics to more advanced topics
- Occasional small exercises or experiments to reinforce learning

## Learning resources
The material is primarily based on:
- The Rust Programming Language (The Rust Book)
- Rust by Example
- Official Rust documentation

## Repository structure
- Each folder represents a Rust topic or concept
- `.rs` files contain runnable examples
- `notes.md` files summarize important takeaways

## Goal
Develop a solid understanding of Rust fundamentals and apply them confidently
in real-world backend and systems programming scenarios.
